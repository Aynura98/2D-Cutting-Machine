# 2D-Cutting-Machine
In this work, the control of a laser cutting machine has been carried out, with the aim of extracting certain figures already assigned from a rectangular piece of earthenware. Therefore, the control problem has focused on planning the trajectory through polynomial functions, in this case through a fifth-order polynomial.
